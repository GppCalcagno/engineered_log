            <p>
              Since 2024, I&rsquo;ve been working with a large European company that supports me financially while I contribute as a <b>Data Scientist</b>.  
              My role mainly involves applying data-driven approaches to optimize industrial processes, with a strong focus on the <b>manufacturing sector</b>.  
              This includes analyzing production data, identifying inefficiencies, and helping design solutions that improve performance, reduce waste, and increase overall productivity.

              In addition to my main job, I enjoy exploring new ideas through <b>personal side projects</b>.  
              These projects allow me to experiment with technologies I&rsquo;m passionate about and continue learning outside of work.  
              Currently, I&rsquo;m dedicating my free time to building this website.

          During my academic journey, I also had the chance to work on projects that led to publications in conferences and peer-reviewed journals. 
          I contributed to a few papers, mainly exploring how machine learning can be applied to optimize manufacturing processes.

          <p className="mb-4">
            Throughout my life, I&rsquo;ve dedicated a lot of time to practicing sports. Like most children, I started with <b>football</b>, and I still enjoy playing casual matches with friends.
            Later, I switched to <b>rowing</b> for a few years. However, the early morning training sessions were too much for me. Still, my love for water sports remained, so I moved on to <b>swimming</b>.
            I&rsquo;d say I was quite good at it and I even had the chance to compete.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            When I moved to my current city, a new <i>sports chapter</i> began. These days, I focus on <b>going to the gym</b>, practicing <b>calisthenics</b> in open-air parks, <b>running</b>, and <b>bouldering</b>.
            Here are some key record metrics from my training:
