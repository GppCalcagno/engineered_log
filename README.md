## :books: Citations & Inspiration

This project is inspired and informed by several fantastic resources. Here are some of the main influences:

- The website design is heavily inspired by [Tania Rascia’s website](https://www.taniarascia.com/). (I hope that's okay—I'm not great at design, but I'm good at “getting inspired.”)
- My motivation for building this site came from reading [Mr. RIP’s blog](https://retireinprogress.com/) and exploring his "knowledge source."
- All illustrations are sourced from [StorySet](https://storyset.com).
- For more inspiration and templates, I also refer to the excellent [Portfolio Ideas repository](https://github.com/Evavic44/portfolio-ideas).
